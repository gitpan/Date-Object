################

Date::Object - Handles dates/calendars/timezones and it's representation/convertions using a single Date::Object.

###############
# DESCRIPTION #
###############

Date::Object is an alternative to the L<DateTime> modules, with the main pourpose
to handle dates using a single object or make multiple I<Date::Object>s work together
to calculate and handle dates.

Other main poupose of I<Date::Object> is to find a simple way to store dates
in a persistent enverioment (any database) using a simple INTEGER field.
The use of a INTEGER field for that make possible searches in the DB by ranges,
what is impossible with normal storages of dates, specially if they are saved as STRING,
generally in the comon format of "YYYY-MM-DD". Also an INTEGER field have all the informations
of a date, including I<year, month, day, hour, minute, second and timezone>. Other good
thing is that any DB supports INTEGER fields, what doesn't make our Perl code dependent
of the SQL nuances of each different way to handle dates of each DB.
